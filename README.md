## About me

My name is Daniel Hill. I am a previous biotech researcher working to transition into data analytics / science / engineering. This is one of my first guided projects to give me a feel for the field
before working on developing my own projects. :) Again, I am following a project by Data with Baraa, and I give full credit to him for this project.
